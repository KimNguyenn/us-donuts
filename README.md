# US Donuts // Julian and Kim 
Our names are Julian and Kim and we are students from Madison Academic High School. Our plan was to make a creative and
useful website that would be easy to navigate items for the customers of US Donuts. To start off, we designed outlines 
that would showcase the items US Donuts offers. We included pictures to give the viewer a visual of US Donuts's specialties.
Since US Donuts doesn't have a website they could benefit from the one we have created. This website should help US Donuts 
to connect with their customers because of the contact and about page we included. Also we included an order page so US Donuts
has another convenient way of serving customers.
### Problems we encountered:
- The navigation bar was the first thing we attemped to code but the navigation bar that [Codecademy](https://www.codecademy.com/courses/make-a-website/lessons/bootstrap/exercises/connect-bootstrap?action=lesson_resume) used did not show horizontally like we designed. To make it go horizontally, we ended us using the topnav code and used css to make the navigation bar.
- Pictures were a problem the whole class had. When putting in placeholders, the pictures did not show up. Pictures taken with our own camera would not show up. But, eventually, we figured out if there was a forward slash (/) infront of the src file link, the picture would not be there. (Ex. src="/img/fallfavorites1.jpg")
- We wanted to include a slideshow on the home page and in the beginning we attempted to use the different codes [W3Schools](https://www.w3schools.com/w3css/w3css_slideshow.asp) had but we discovered it was not a rescale-friendly code. A code we found on [CodePen](https://codepen.io/) was a css slideshow, which let us adjust the times and size of the pictures.
- The website had a problem being responsive on smaller screens. Our footer was especially messed up on smaller screens. On big screens it was no problem for it to be responsive, but on smaller screens the words would stack over another.
- For the order page, it took days to correct the layout because the order summary would sit next to the order form. We designed for the order summary to be on the bottom. On smaller screens the order summary would be in the right spot but the problem was on bigger screens.
